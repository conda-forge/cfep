## Abstract

Source packages that we use to create conda packages have terms and conditions that allow
us to redistribute the package in binary form. This CFEP codifies the conduct when these
violations are reported.

## Implementation

When a violation is brought to the attention of the Core team, the feedstock maintenance
team should be made aware by the Core team in a github issue on the feedstock and notified using the
github handle.

A specified time period would be given to the maintenance team to respond to the claim and
a specified time period would be given to address the issue.

If the issue is not addressed after the specified time period, the package will be moved
to the broken label.
